        <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
       
        <p>It all started when Sega, Nintendo’s marketing rival,</p> 
            <p>wanted to create a cool new mascot for their company to surpass Nintendo’s Mario.</p>
            <p>Developers Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima and Hirokazu then came up with the famous blue hedgehog we know today: Sonic the hedgehog,</p> 
                <p>with his original release date being on June 23rd 1991.</p>
                <img src="img/img2/comingsoon.svg" id="#comingsoon">
            <p>His fur is blue to represent the blue colour of SEGA's logo, and his shoes are red to represent his speed,</p>
            <p>but also in reference to Micheal Jackson and Santa Claus (since Sonic is born in Christmas Island!)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sonic didn't look like how he does today- he actually went through many design and name changes!</p>
            <p>First off being a blue rabbit, commonly named "Feels" by the fandom.</p>
            <p>Secondly being "Mr Hedgehog" or also known as "Mr Needlemouse" (a translation error to Mr Hedgehog)</p>
            <p>who's design was getting closer to the Sonic we know of today.</p>
            <p>Overall, Sonic's initial adventures was to run around the world and defeat the evil genius Eggman alongside with his buddy Tails.</p>

                <p>who used to be one of Sonic's rivals, due to Eggman tricking Knuckles into thinking he's a foe who wants to steal the Master Emerald from him.</p>
                <p>However, after learning that Eggman lied to him, Knuckles formed an alliance with Sonic,</p>

                <p>In the recent years, Amy has shown to be more mature and more independent, and prefers to give her love to the world.</p>
                <p>Now she is more described as being in love with the concept of love itself, with Sonic being admiration.</p>
                <p>Amy was originally meant to be the equivalent to Mario'S Peach or Mickey's Minnie, </p>
                <p>but SEGA thought that Sonic having a girlfriend or love interest would contradict his character,</p>
                <p>so they thought it would be more interesting if they made her crush mostly one sided.</p>

                <p>in order to find a cure to Maria's disease. Shadow is created of Maria and Black Doom's DNA (Black Doom is offered his blood with one condition:</p>
                <p>that after fifty years, Shadow brings the seven chaos emeralds (that, when all together, grants great force and power) back to him.)</p>
                <p>Shadow is titled as the "Ultimate Lifeform" as he is more powerful than Sonic and his friends, as well as he is immortal. He develops a sisterly relationship with Maria, </p>
                <p>since she's the only person who didn't view him as a dangerous weapon. Due to Shadow being too powerful, an agency called G.U.N invaded the Ark to capture Shadow. </p>
                <p>Because she didn't want Shadow to get hurt, Maria placed him in a tube to propulse him on Earth, and protect it. Instead of Shadow getting killed, Maria did protecting him.</p>
                <p>Her dying wish to Shadow is to protect the Earth. Shadow got frozen/in unconcious state for 50 years, until he arrive to Sonic's timeline.</p>

                <p>Dr Ivo Robotnik, most commonly known as Eggman, is Sonic's biggest ennemy. Eggman's plan is to rule the world to his image (for fun) and destroying some parts of it which is against Sonic's beliefs.</p>
                <p>One of the other reasons Eggman hates Sonic so much is because the blue hedgehog doesn't take him seriously. To Robotnik, Sonic is his nemesis, while to Sonic, Eggman is just another bad egg.</p>
                <p>One of Eggman's most recognizeable and loyal creations is Metal Sonic, programmed to capture and destroy Sonic. Metal opperates through Sonic's thoughts, and truly believes to be the "Real Sonic"</p>
