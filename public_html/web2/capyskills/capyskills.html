    <h1>CapyThon-CapySkill I worked on</h1>
    <p>Goal: Interact and participate effectively with others</p>
        <p>Level: 6?</p>
       <p> Why: I chose what I would do for the project and understand what Iâ€™m supposed to do. I would also stay on schedule and make sure I complete by the deadlines.</p>
       <p> What I need to work on: form stronger team relationships with other years, ask more questions and bring ideas to the project.</p>
